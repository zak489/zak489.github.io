<h2> Welcome! </h2>

<<<<<<< HEAD
This site is the home for all my science-related things.  
I am currently a postdoc in Ben Lanyon's group in University of Innsbruck, Austria.
My PhD research centered on engineering coherent light-matter interactions in semiconductor quantum dots.

This site is the home for all my PhD-related things. Whether that's posters I present, talks I give, or just scattered thoughts I have on PhDs in general. 

My interests are not only in research but also cover outreach and trying to make Universities kinder places to be for everyone, especially groups like disabled and queer students.
Or sometimes I might just talk about a fun department quiz - who knows!
