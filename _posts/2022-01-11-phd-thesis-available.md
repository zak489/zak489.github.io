An email in the morning of the 7th of January 2022 marks the day where I am finally done with my PhD! Final version of my thesis submission has been accepted by the student service center and I am officially (PhD-)done! Great thanks to everyone that is involved in the projects, especially my supervisor, Brian for taking me in as a PhD student and offering the precious funding for me to work on the exciting topic of semiconductor quantum dot single photon sources. While it might take about a year or two for the university to update their repository, for anyone who is interested in my thesis, [(_here it is_)](https://alexandrecoates.github.io/assets/documents/Coates,%20Lovett,%20Gauger%20-%202021%20-%20Localisation%20determines%20the%20optimal%20noise%20rate%20for%20quantum%20transport.pdf). Hope people find it interesting enough for a read (spoiler: most of the work depicted in the thesis are published but there are some unpublished **gems** that might be interesting to explore further!)

It is time for holidayyy.....
