I work on light-matter interactions in quantum emitters. Currently a postdoc in Ben Lanyon's group in University of Innsbruck, Austria.
Previously, I worked as a PhD student with Brian Gerardot's group in Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK. The thesis title is "Coherent Light-matter Interactions in Semiconductor Quantum Dots". I sing in choirs, play chess/ Tetris and enjoy trekking outdoors in my spare time.
<!-- In short, I'm about theoretical physics, outreach, and improving the PhD experience for people. 

I'm working through the early stages of a PhD in Open Quantum Systems and Quantum Biology, fitting that in-between emailing places and asking them to do better by students. 
In my spare time, I imagine what I'd do if I had more spare time, currently I'm really looking forward to finding more opportunities for public engagement and science outreach. -->
