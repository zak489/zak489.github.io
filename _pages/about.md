I am an experimental quantum physicist, working as a PostDoc from February 2022 at University of Innsbruck, Austria. The theme of my research centers on quantum engineering, as I worked on engineering light-matter interaction for coherent control of semiconductor quantum dots in my PhD at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK. Dreaming about a career in science
In my spare time, I sing in choirs, play chess/ tetris and enjoy trekking in the outdoors.
=======
In short, I'm about theoretical physics, outreach, and improving the PhD experience for people. 



I'm working through the early stages of a PhD in Open Quantum Systems and Quantum Biology, fitting that in-between emailing places and asking them to do better by students. 
In my spare time, I imagine what I'd do if I had more spare time, currently I'm really looking forward to finding more opportunities for public engagement and science outreach.
