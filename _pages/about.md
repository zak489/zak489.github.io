I work on light-matter interactions in quantum emitters. I am currently a postdoc in Ben Lanyon's group in University of Innsbruck, Austria.
Previously, I worked as a PhD student in Brian Gerardot's group in Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, UK. The thesis title is "Coherent Light-matter Interactions in Semiconductor Quantum Dots". I sing in choirs, play chess/ Tetris and enjoy trekking outdoors in my spare time.
